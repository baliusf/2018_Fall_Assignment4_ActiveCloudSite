<h1>Strategy & Implementation</h1>
<hr />
<p>A popular quote by Warren Buffet says “Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing” in the context of Stock picking as it is an important factor for capital market investment success. Strategies like 52-Week Price Range Strategy, Cash return on invested capital check, Return on Equity are well known techniques which forms the basis for selecting a stock. For this project we have implemented 52-week price momentum strategy to select the top five stocks.</p>
<hr />

<h2>What is a '52-Week High/Low'?</h2>
<p>It is intuitive that human learns based on his past experience or learnings. This idea forms the crux of many popular strategies and algorithms and 52-Week High/Low is a paragon of this. It is the highest and the lowest price that a stock has traded at during the previous year and investors term it as an crucial indicator in determining a stock’s current value and forecasting it.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Idea behind the Strategy:</h2>
<p>The 52-week high/low figure often acts as a decision point as stock traders may buy a stock when the price exceeds its 52-week high, or sell when the price falls below its 52-week low. The principle behind this strategy is “Movement of inertia” (a popular concept in physics) which says that if worth of a price falls out from the 52-week range (either above or below), there is enough momentum to continue the price move in the identical direction.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Determining the “High” Value Stocks</h2>
<p>The stock value is like an oscillating pendulum and inorder to stabilize the strategy in 52-week high/low we consider the daily closing price. If a stock value goes beyond 52-week high intra-day, but end up closing below the previous 52-week high then we don’t consider this as a potential case of “high” and emphasize more on the closing value rather than all the values recorded during the trading on any particular given day.</p>
<hr />

<h2>52-Week Price Momentum Strategy</h2>
<p>Price momentum, is used in pickingup the top 5 stocks and we consider the proximity of a stock to its 52-week high or low. The formula that we used to measure price momentum was </p>
<h4>Price momentum = (Current price - 52 week low) / (52 week high - 52 week low) </h4>
<p>Stocks that score  around 82% or higher on this formula tend to outperform, while stocks that score 41% or lower tend to underperform. </p>
<p>Regarding the implementation, the symbols tab will take little time to load since it fetches quote for all the companies present in the server after which it computes the price momentum from the above mentioned formula.</p>

<h1>Self Reflections</h1>
<h4>Kartikay Bali</h4>
<p>I gave this project a decent amount of time even while doing the assignment not just to build the website but also to learn the stock market strategies. Working on this project was really helpful in developing both my technical and business knowledge as I got to learn interesting stuff about the stock market. I have developed numerous mobile apps and little components of web apps in Ruby. This was my first C# web app. By the end of this project, I am really confident in myself in building a C# web app. Even though we struggled a little to search for the best api as per the requirements, but after searching and exploring for a while we understood stock markets and it has also gotten a new turn and now I could see stuff related to stocks in a totally different perspective that would definitely help me in my career.</p>

<h4>Baranidhar Eswaramoorthy Manoharan</h4>
<p>While doing this project, I had the opportunity to learn the advantages that a cloud platform like Azure had to offer. Also, I had a real time exposure working with an API that pulls the live data from a stock picking site. I had good time learning new concepts especially Azure and also in the business domain I got to learn about the stock marketing strategies.</p>

<h4>Uday Karnam</h4>
<p>My involving myself in this project I gained the first hand experience of deploying a web application into a cloud and also extracting the top 5 quotes from the stock API. Besides this project reinforced my skills in MVC concepts as I get acquainted with these concepts once again and the outcomes from the actions of saving the data to database and generating the charts are worth notable. At a broader level this project furnished me with the opportunity to engulf in the web application development concepts holistically and to gain invaluable experience on the same.</p>
